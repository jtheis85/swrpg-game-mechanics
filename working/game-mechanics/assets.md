# Assets

## Assets and Command
Characters needn’t have command skills related to assets they use, or any command skills at all for that matter.

At first it may seem strange that a character focusing on Infantry Command could call in an airstrike (or even an orbital strike). However, assets don’t represent direct command authority. They are meant to provide an abstract way for complex military forces to cooperate. The infantry commander isn’t “in charge” of the spacecraft delivering the strike, they are simply requesting support that was made available.

If the character calling upon an asset does have a related command skill, it may be appropriate for them to (temporarily) take command of the asset, provided they outrank the current commander. For example, a character with starfighter command could call upon an aerospace asset in the form of allied starfighters. In addition to friendly NPC starfighters assisting in combat, the character could issue those commands and orders, such as target priorities.


## Combat Assets

### Types

#### Reconnaissance
Provide pre-op intel, in-op info

#### Logistics
Provide supplies, transportation, and recovery options.

#### Operational
Operational assets are generally “off screen” in the sense that they usually don’t directly affect the team’s immediate, local situation. Examples include affecting the enemy’s assets in another area (e.g. a commando raid on a nearby anti-aircraft battery), or participating on another front of battle (e.g. a flight of X-wings protecting the team’s movements from flanking enemies).

#### Tactical
Tactical assets are generally “on screen” in the sense that they will usually directly affect the team’s immediate, local situation. Examples include affecting enemies in the immediate area (e.g. an allied sniper killing a Stormtrooper), or directly participating (e.g. a landspeeder patrol providing close air support against advancing AT-AT’s).

### Domains

#### Ground
Infantry and ground vehicles
