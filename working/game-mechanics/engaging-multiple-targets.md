A combat round represents about a minute’s worth of activity, plenty of time to attack multiple targets. However, a character does so at the expense of focusing their fire. Whenever you want to attack more than one target, declare all the targets you’d like to attack before you roll. You roll only once using the target with the highest total number of negative dice (difficulty, challenge, and setback). If you hit, reduce the damage by the largest soak value from among your targets (even if that is a different target than the dice you used). You may then spread the remaining damage among your chosen targets, without applying any further soak.
