- Consider some weapons/attachments which balance benefits with drawbacks (e.g. setback dice or threat symbols)
- Soak from armor converts damage to strain?

Assist

NOTE: The base game rules for assisting are far simpler than those we used in Jim's game. There's no roll or skill check, just spending a maneuver (on your turn).

All assists automatically provide a boost die, no roll required.

Assisting players do not roll to assist. If the PC is able to assist and chooses to do so, they automatically  provide a boost die to the assisted player. If desired, an assisting player can roll the boost die and  provide the result to the assisted player.

You must be trained to assist.

Generally PCs can only assist (mechanically) if they are trained in the skill they are using to assist. Certain  exceptions can be made by the GM for high characteristic ratings, appropriate tools, or other  circumstances.

Only one assist per relevant skill.

Generally only one PCs can (mechanically) assist another for any given skill. If applicable per the GM,  other PCs may assist using other skills, but only once for each skill (e.g. an Astrogation check may be  assisted by one other PC using Astrogation and another using Computers).

Destiny Points
Each player has a separate pool of destiny points.

Downgrading Dice
The core rules specify that when downgrading dice, if there are more downgrades than Proficiency and Challenge dice available, these downgrades are ignored.

Instead, Ability or Difficulty dice should be removed, with a minimum of one die remaining. This mirrors upgrading beyond the available dice, and is important with other rules changes, such as cover downgrading attacks rather than applying setback dice.
