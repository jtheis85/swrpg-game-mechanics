Auto-Fire  p.168
The advantage in using auto-fire is that it can make hitting target easier. However, as it is less precise, the resulting damage can be less.
Reduce the difficulty of the attack by choosing an amount up to the auto-fire rating. Reduce the total resulting damage by double the chosen value.
Note: Damage is reduced only once (i.e. the total is reduced) in the case of engaging multiple targets. Reduce the total damage, apply soak per the Engaging Multiple Targets rule, then spread the resulting damage as desired.
Burst-Fire
Burst fire is identical to auto-fire, but you may not choose multiple targets when using burst fire.
Disorient p.169
In addition to a variable number of rounds of disorientation a weapon inflicts, disorienting weapons also have a severity rating. The first number represents the severity, which adds an number of setback dice. The second represents the number of rounds the disorientation lasts for. As the duration approaches its final round, one setback die should be removed each round such that the final round has a single setback die remaining.
Example: A weapon has a rating of Disorient 3 (4r). When activated, the target gets 3 setback dice for their next 2 turns. On the 3rd turn, 2 setback dice, on the 4th, 1 setback die, with no setback dice on the 5th turn.
Initiative p.210
As the “Cool” skill no longer exists, only Vigilance is used to determine initiative.
Aim p.213-214
Aiming a sidearm requires two hands. When using a side arm with one hand (because your other hand is unavailable), you cannot use the aim maneuver with it. When wielding a sidearm in each hand, you cannot aim either of them.
Soak p.221
No matter how much soak you have, a successful hit with a lethal personal scale weapon always causes a minimum of one wound. 
Example: A weapon does 5 base damage, and a character makes an attack that results in one success, for a total of 6 wounds. A target with 6 soak (4 from Brawn and 2 from armor) would still take one wound, even though 6-6=0.
Note: This does NOT apply to armor and planetary-scale weapons.
Note: Any effects that require the damage to exceeds the character’s soak value (e.g. removing the benefits of aiming, or causing critical wounds) still apply as normal. If a character with 3 soak takes 3 points of damage (reduced to one), they do not lose the benefits of aiming and cannot be critically injured by this attack. Only exceeding the soak (e.g. 4 points or more) would cause this.
Critical Injuries p.230
Characters with no critical injuries apply a -50 to their rolls against the critical injury table (to a minimum of 1). However, each critical injury they already have adds +20 to the roll. Normally, this roll begins with no modifier and adds +10 for each injury. This means that characters generally have a better idea of how bad off they are, with penalizing injuries being less random and unpredictable. 
Recovering from Strain p.233
At the end of an encounter, each player can make a Simple (-) Discipline check. Each success recovers one strain. In the base rules, a Cool check could be made instead. As cool no longer exists as a skill, this is not an option.
