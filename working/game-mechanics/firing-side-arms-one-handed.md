Proper technique generally dictates that a sidearm is fired with both hands, although this advice can be discarded in some circumstances, especially where only one hand is free.

Generally speaking during the game, you don't need to be overly specific about what your hands are doing and which hand or hands your weapon is in. However, under certain circumstances where one hand is clearly occupied on a long term basis (like while holding on to a dangling rope, or helping to carry a wounded comrade), some penalties can be imposed.

Having only one hand free to fire a sidearm adds a single setback die. Some sidearms have a Cumb rating specifically when fired one-handed, which also applies if your Brawn is not high enough.
