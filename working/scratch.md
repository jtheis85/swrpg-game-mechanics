Critical Hits
- Subtract 20 from all critical hit rolls. This can eventually be cancelled by multiple critical hits as normal (e.g. after 2 critical hits, the +20 and -20 cancel out). Criticals with a value below 1 have no adverse effect beyond needing to be healed in order to remove the +10 bonus to future critical rolls.

A-wing
- Has a defense value of 1 on both defense zones
