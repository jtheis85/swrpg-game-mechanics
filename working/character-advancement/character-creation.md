Character Creation
Choose Starting Roles
Summary: 4 roles, one from each domain
Each player chooses a role from each gameplay domain (Personal Combat, Vehicular Combat, Infiltration, and Social Interaction). Each role has a primary characteristic, a primary skill, and secondary skills. Players are free to choose roles with overlapping or non-overlapping skills and characteristics as they see fit.
Choose Characteristics
Summary: Two 3’s (one primary only), three 2’s, one 1 (non-primary only) - [3,3,2,2,2,1]
Characters begin with all characteristics at a value of 2. The player must choose one characteristics from among the primary characteristics of their 4 chosen roles, and raise it to 3. They must then choose another characteristic (different from the first) and raise it to 3. Finally they must choose a 3rd characteristic NOT among the primary characteristics of their 4 chosen roles, and lower it to 1. 
Choose Career Skills
Summary: All role-primary skills. One secondary skill from each role. 8 skills in total.
All role primary skills are automatically considered career skills. The player must also choose one secondary skill from each role as a career skill. This should always yield 8 career skills.
Gain Bonus Skill Ranks
Characters automatically gain a bonus rank in each of their career skills. This should always yield exactly 8 skills with a single rank.
Choose Bonus “Skill Focus” Rank
Summary: Raise one role-primary skill to rank 2
The player must choose a single role-primary skill as their “focus”. This skill gains a bonus rank, becoming Rank 2. The player should come up with a short backstory or reason why they are currently focused in this area. This focus has no other effect, and the player can choose to pursue other options in the future. 
Choose a bonus “Outlier” skill rank
Summary: Raise one non-career skill to rank 1
The player must choose a single skill which is not one of their 8 career skills. It gains a bonus rank, but does not become a career skill. The player should come up with a short backstory or reason why they are skilled in this area.
End Result
After character creation, each character should have 4 roles, 8 career skills, and 10 skill ranks. They should also have 2 characteristics at rank 3, 3 at rank 2, and 1 at rank 1.
