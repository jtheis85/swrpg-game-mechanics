Item Qualities
Spread
Weapons with the Spread quality can hit where other weapons would miss. They can also damage multiple targets at a time, albeit with reduced damage.

When this weapon misses, add a number of automatic successes equal to its spread rating. If the attack then hits, reduce the total damage by the spread rating.

If an attack by this weapon misses by a number of successes less than or equal to its spread rating, the attack hits and does damage equal to the weapon’s base damage value minus the number of uncancelled failures.

W
Example 1: A weapon (damage 5 spread 2) rolls an attack that results in 0 uncancelled successes and failures (miss by 1 success, less than spread). This attack hits for 5-0=5 damage.
Example 2: A weapon (damage 5 spread 2) rolls an attack that results in 1 uncancelled failure (miss by 2 successes, equal to spread). This attack hits for 5-1=4 damage.
Example 3: A weapon (damage 5 spread 3) rolls an attack that results in 2 uncancelled failures (miss by 3 successes, equal to spread). This attack hits for 5-2=3 damage.  
Example 3: A weapon with a damage rating of 5 and a spread rating of 2 rolls an attack that results in 0 successes and 0 uncancelled failures. This attack hits (thanks to adding two automatic successes from spread). However, it only deals 5 damage (5+2-2) as the spread rating is subtracted from the total.
