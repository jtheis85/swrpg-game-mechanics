RoF and Limited Ammo - Consume 1 additional ammo for each level of RoF (player can voluntarily operate at a lower rate of fire to conserve ammo)
Cooldown and Limited Ammo - Each additional target engaged consumes one additional ammo

Rof vs cooldown
High cooldown = engage fewer targets, more taxed successes
Low cooldown = fewer taxed successes, engage more targets
High rof = hit on miss with lower dmg, add rof to dmg on normal success vs single target
Low rof = just miss

High rof low cool down = automatic
High rof high cool down = burst
Low rof low cd = semi auto
Low rof high cd = bolt, magnum

Choose to target multiple enemies before or after rolling?

- After would reduce initial analysis paralysis, could add overhead to every attack roll
- Before would require some more player skill
- Before could leave room for abilities that Let you choose after
- Taxed successes would be subtracted for ALL targets BEFORE determining whether ANY targets are hit. Get too greedy, and you might not hit anything!

Players may divide their uncancelled successes between multiple targets.  Each target must be assigned at least one success to apply any damage. Additional successes only apply to one chosen target (players choice) each. Each target's soak applies to the damage it receives.

Default semi auto rof taxes one success to hit each additional target. So hitting 2 targets requires 3 uncancelled successes, while hitting 3 targets requires 5. (each beyond the first requires 2 successes).

Low rof (bolt, magnum) taxes 2 successes. So hitting 2 targets requires 4 uncancelled successes.

High rof taxes no successes. So hitting 2 targets requires 2 uncancelled successes, while hitting 3 targets requires 3.

Taxed successes are simply removed once spent to hit an additional target. They do not count as additional damage, or provide any other benefit.

RoF vs Single targets

Low RoF weapons gain no (additional) benefits when engaging a single target

Medium RoF weapons still "hit" with 0 successes, albeit without the +1 damage that success offers

High RoF weapons still "hit" with up to 1 failure, albeit at reduced damage
