Minimum and Maximum Range
Ranged weapons have a minimum range band and a maximum range band. By default, ranged weapons can be used in the Engaged range band at minimum, and the Extreme range band at maximum unless otherwise specified. If specified, weapons can generally not be used outside their minimum to maximum range, although there may be rare exceptional cases.
Example 1: A Blaster Sniper Rifle has a minimum range band of Short. It cannot be used while Engaged without specific overriding circumstances and GM approval.
Example 2: A Blaster Pistol has a maximum range band of Long. It cannot be used at Extreme range without specific overriding circumstances and GM approval.
Ideal Range
Ranged weapons have a range band (or bands) that they are ideally used in. When using a weapon in one of its ideal range bands, the difficulty defaults to [DD]. When using a weapon outside of its ideal range bands, the difficulty increases by [D] for each band below or above the nearest ideal band.
Note: Ranged attacks generally are not [D] or [-] unless some circumstance makes them so.
Example 1: A Blaster Rifle has an ideal range of Medium. When used at medium range, the difficulty is [DD]. When used at Short or Long range, the difficulty is [DDD]. When used at Engaged or Extreme range, the difficulty is [DDDD].
Example 2: A Blaster Sniper Rifle has an ideal range of Long-Extreme. When used at Long or Extreme range, the difficulty is [DD]. When used at Medium range, the difficulty is [DDD]. At short it is [DDDD]. It normally cannot be used while engaged, but if circumstances (and the GM) allow, it would be at difficulty [DDDDD].
