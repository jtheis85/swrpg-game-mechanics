Perhaps weapons should do more base damage to have more variety in armor levels (0,1, and 2 being a narrow range).

Damage

- Differentiate tiers of weapon "calibers"
    - e.g. Pistol "caliber" includes SMG equivalent
    - e.g. Carbine firing rifle "caliber"

Range

- Emphasize weapon roles to encourage use of different weapons in different situations
- Smooth over silly things like sniper rifles being "easy" to use at close range

Piercing

- Emphasize weapon effectiveness against armored foes.
- Note that against sufficient soak, +1 pierce = +1 damage. However, against lighter armored targets, extra pierce is ignored. Therefore, can be used as a "softer" damage increase, as it is strictly worse in certain situations. However, keep in mind that an average, unarmored human has 2 soak (from Brawn 2), and that most foes will have at least 3 soak (from +1 armor) if not 4 or 5 (from some combination of 2-3 brawn and +2 armor). So the dropoff in effectiveness of pierce vs a raw damage increase only truly begins at Pierce 3-4.

Critical

- Further emphasize weapon stopping power
- Also has the side effect of quickly dispatching minions

Rate of Fire

- Differentiate between weapons that deal damage via volume of fire (ease of partially hitting) and high power (i.e. good vs armor)
    - How is this different than pierce?
- Reflect ease/difficutly of engaging multiple targets
- Replace the somewhat counterintuitive auto fire mechanics which make it LESS likely to hit a target (or targets) at all in exchange for more damage
- Maybe  rate of fire as an overall abstraction for slow firing, burst fire, auto fire, and engaging multiple targets, extra damage to single targets

Stock

- No/Short stock - Hard to aim, less encumbering, easier to maneuver in close quarters
- Long stock - Weapon is easier to aim or more accurate, but is more encumbering and difficult to maneuver in (or use?) in close quarters.
- Collapsing stock - can toggle between the aim ability of the long stock or the ease of use/maneuvering in close quarters.
