# Weapon Qualities

## Blinding
Blinding weapons, such as flash grenades, use intense light to temporarily blind and otherwise disorient targets. On a successful hit, blinding weapons are automatically disorient the target with the indicated severity and duration, with no special activation required. Each additional success affects another target engaged with the first.

// TODO: Is duration really worth having? Perhaps longer duration could  be handled with extra advantages? Or is the ~1 min duration of a round already enough?
