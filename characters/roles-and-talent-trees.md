# Roles and Talent Trees

Talent trees are shared among all the roles. Each role grants free access to a number of talent trees, but most talent trees can be accessed outside of a given role for a small XP fee (~15XP?).

## Role Talent Tree Overlapping

A character might find that they are granted the same talent tree for free from more than one source (a role, or elsewhere). If this is the case, the character receives no additional benefit or experience refund. Players may want to choose a variety of roles for exactly this reason: to maximize the benefit of free talent tree access.
