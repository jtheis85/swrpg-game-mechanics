## Push the Limit
* **Free** - Spend 2 strain to perform an additional maneuver, provided you take no more than 2 maneuvers total on your turn from any source. (This is as written in the original rules).
* **Less Straining** - The cost of Push the Limit is lowered to 1 strain.
* **Higher Limit** - You may spend 1 additional strain to use Push the Limit for one additional maneuver even if you are already at the 2 maneuver limit for this turn. You must still spend the normal amount of strain to activate Push the Limit.

# Dodge
* **Free** - Spend 1 strain to add 1 setback die to any ranged or melee attack targeting you as an incidental. You may not spend more strain than your ranks in coordination. All characters automatically have the Dodge talent for free.
* **Improved** - Spend up to 2 strain to add that number of setback dice. You still may not spend more strain than your ranks in coordination.
* **Supreme** - Spend up to 3 strain to add that number of setback dice. You still may not spend more strain than your ranks in coordination.
// While not in cover? Must have moved in their past turn?
