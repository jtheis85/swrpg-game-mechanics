# Mobile Protection
While wearing armor with base soak 2 or higher, you do not count as exposed based on your current surroundings (you could still be considered exposed by other effects).

# Hard Shell
* **Basic** - Once per session, while wearing armor with base soak 2 or higher, spend a destiny point to reduce an attack's damage by your wound threshold (in addition to your normal soak). This damages the armor, reducing its soak by 1 until it can be repaired.
* **Reduced Cost** - No longer requires a destiny point to be spent.
* **Improved Frequency** - Can be used once per encounter (but only if the armor has undamaged base soak remaining).
