# Offense

How do you "bring the pain" to the enemy?

* Assault - Get in their faces with close range weapons like compacts and grenades
* Barrage - Lay waste from a distance with devastating, high-volume fire
* Marksmanship - Eliminate key targets with precision
* Supporting fire - Your primary focus isn't on attacking the enemy, but you can assist as needed

# Protection

How do you keep yourself safe on the battlefield?

* Armor - Rely on the layers of protection you're wearing to shrug off fire
* Concealment - Stay out of sight. They can't hit what they can't see.
* Cover - Keep your head down, behind something solid
* Maneuver - Stay mobile. Better to be a moving target than a sitting duck.

# Support

What are you doing to help the team when you aren't shooting/being shot at

* Triage - Keep the squad alive
* Squad Tactics - Keep the squad coordinated and working together
