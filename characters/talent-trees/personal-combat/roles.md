// If Roles are just pre-set selections of talent trees, how should primary weapons be determined?

// Also, some archetypal roles seem to not necessarily have a "support" function, as their primary use is offense (e.g. sniper, gunner). Maybe some trees cost more than others, resulting in some more focused roles and more flexible ones (e.g. squad leader)

// Maybe roles ARE manditory (to provide proficiencies), but SOME trees/proficiencies can be swapped, e.g. medic requires triage, but can choose from betwen supporting fire and marksmanship

// Or maybe certain trees grant proficiencies (or even provide the means to gain ranks, instead of gaining ranks independently)
