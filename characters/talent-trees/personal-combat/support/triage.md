# Natural Doctor
* **Basic** - Once per session, spend a destiny point to reroll a medicine check. You must explain the lucky circumstances that transpired that caused the check to go awry. You must accept the result of the reroll. If the reroll is worse than the original, you explain what terrible luck befell you (e.g you sutured the wound but nicked an artery causing internal bleeding)!
* **Reduced Cost** - Natural Doctor no longer requires a destiny point to be spent.
* **Improved Frequency** - Allows Natural Doctor to be used once per encounter.

## Master Doctor
* **Basic** - Once per round, spend 2 strain to decrease the difficulty of a medicine check by 1.
* **Reduced Cost** - Master Doctor requires only 1 strain to be spent.
* **Increased Effect** - Master Doctor decreases the difficulty of the check by 2 (to a minimum of 1). 
// Meh... Seems like just increasing your medicine skill is better overall. Maybe this speaks to having a separate currency for talents (e.g. low tier talents cost 1 point, 2nd tier cost 2, etc). 

## Combat Medic (x2)
Whenever you make a medicine check while in combat, the target of your check gains additional ranged defense equal to ranks in Combat Medic

## First Do No Harm
* **Basic** Once per session, cancel all results (positive and negative) of one of your medicine checks.
* **Increased Frequency** - First do no harm
