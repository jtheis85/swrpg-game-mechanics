## Solid Cover 
* **Free** - While in heavy cover, increase your soak by 1.
* **Lower Limit** - While in medium cover, increase your soak by 1.
* **More Soak** - While in heavy cover, increase your soak by an additional 1.

## Hug Cover 
* **Free** - While in cover, take an action to spend 2 strain to improve it by one step (for yourself only) until the start of your next turn.
* **Less Straining** - The cost of Hug Cover is lowered to 1 strain.
* **Improved Speed** - Hugging cover takes a maneuver rather than an action.
* **Improved Duration** - The benefits of hug cover last an additional turn (provided you remain in cover)

## Improvised Cover
* **Free** - Once per session, spend a destiny point to establish the existence of a new area of light cover at or near your current location. You must explain what is providing this newfound protection and why it may have been overlooked or unnoticed before now. The GM has the final say as to whether such cover will be allowed, as well as how temporary it may be.
* **Reduced Cost** - Improvised cover no longer requires a destiny point to be spent.
* **Improved Protection** - As Improvised Cover, but allows up to medium cover. The GM has the final say as to how much protection the cover grants.
* **Improved Frequency** - Allows Improvised Cover to be used once per encounter.

## Lucky Break
* **Basic** - Once per session, while in medium or heavy cover, spend a destiny point to force an attack rolled against you to be rerolled. You must explain the lucky circumstances that transpired that caused the attack to go awry. You must accept the result of the reroll. If the reroll is worse than the original, you explain what terrible luck befell you (e.g the attack hit an exploding barrel instead)!
* **Reduced Cost** - Lucky Break no longer requires a destiny point to be spent.
* **Improved Frequency** - Allows Lucky Break to be used once per encounter.
