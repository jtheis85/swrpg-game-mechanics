## Improvised Concealment
* **Free** - Once per session, spend a destiny point to establish the existence of a new area of light (non-cover) concealment at or near your current location. You must explain what is providing this newfound concealment and why it may have been overlooked or unnoticed before now. The GM has the final say as to whether such concealment will be allowed, as well as how temporary it may be.
* **Reduced Cost** - Improvised concealment no longer requires a destiny point to be spent.
* **Improved Protection** - As Improvised Concealment, but allows up to medium concealment. The GM has the final say as to how much protection the concealment grants.
* **Improved Frequency** - Allows Improvised Concealment to be used once per encounter.

## Combat Disappearance
* **Free** - Once per encounter, while in medium or heavy concealment (or equivalent cover providing reasonable concealment), spend a maneuver and 2 strain and make a a daunting (DDDD) stealth check. If you succeed, become completely concealed. Any enemy wishing to target you must first succeed in a perception check (with an appropriate amount of setback dice) opposed by your stealth. Your concealment is broken as normal when taking obvious actions such as firing weapons, speaking loudly, moving into plain view, etc.

// Note: Isn't this something that just a stealth check maneuver should allow you to do?
