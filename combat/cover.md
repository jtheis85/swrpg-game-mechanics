When a character is in an area with a passive cover effect, they automatically gain the listed effect. When a character is within close range of an area with light, medium, or heavy cover, they can take a maneuver to actively take advantage of that cover, gaining gaining the enhanced active effect instead.

Cover can be light, medium, or heavy cover, which downgrade enemy attacks by one, two, or three times, respectively.

_Reminder: When downgrading attacks, first turn Proficiency dice into Ability dice, then remove ability dice. Attacks can never be downgraded below one ability die._

_Design Note: It is important to note that in addition to reducing enemy damage output and chance to hit, cover downgrades also substantially reduce the frequency of enemies scoring a (devastating) triumph._

## Exposed
When a character is in the open and has no way to take cover from ranged attacks, they are said to be Exposed. When exposed, all ranged attacks against the target are automatically upgraded once. Note that a character is generally only considered exposed in an area with no available cover, not simply any character who hasn't taken a maneuver to gain a cover bonus. So a character in the middle of an open field is exposed, while a character in a hallway or doorway may not be.

# Advanced/Situational Rules
The following rules are generally only to be used at the GM's discretion, if the situation calls for it. They are more complex, and may not be appropriate depending on a given encounter's pacing.

## Moving to/from/within cover
To represent characters moving from cover to cover, their cover value depends both on where they started and ended their turn, as well as the area moved through. If a character had better cover at the start of their turn or while moving than their final position, they get a +1 cover bonus until the start of their next turn. If they had worse cover at the start or while moving than their final position, they get a -1 cover penalty until the start of their next turn.

Note: Moving through an area generally uses the passive effect rather than the active effect. There are some exceptions however. Moving through a heavy cover trench or other cover designed for movement within it can provide the active effect at the GMâ€™s discretion. Character abilities or other circumstances may allow this as well.

_**Example 1:** A character begins their turn taking medium cover. They move through an area of light cover, and take cover again in medium cover. Their final cover (2) is greater than the area moved through (0), so their cover this turn is 1. At the start of their next turn, their cover will be 2, and remain so if they stay there._

_**Example 2:** A character begins their turn exposed. They move to an area of heavy cover and take cover there. Their final cover (3) is greater than their starting cover (-1), so their cover this turn is 2._

_**Example 3:** A character begins their turn taking heavy cover. They emerge and move through an area of medium cover and end in an exposed area. Their final cover (-1) is less than both the area moved through (1) their starting cover (3), so it is one higher (0) for this turn. But starting next turn, it will be -1!_

_**Example 4:** A character begins in an area of medium cover (1), moves through heavy cover (2), and ends in medium cover (1). Their final value (1) is less than the value of the area moved through (2), so it is 2 for this round, but will be 1 starting next round._

_**Example 5:** A character begins in an area of heavy cover (2), moves through medium cover (1), and ends in heavy cover (2). Their final value (2) is more than the area moved through (1), so their cover this turn is 1, but next turn will be 2._
